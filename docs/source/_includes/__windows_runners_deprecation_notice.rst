.. note::

    Windows runners will be DEPRECATED in a future release. These runners are being replaced
    by :ref:`WinRM Runners <ref-winrm-runners>` which use a native Python implementation
    of the WinRM protocol. Please migrate all existing actions over to these new runners. Any new
    code should prefer WinRM Runners over the Windows Runners.
