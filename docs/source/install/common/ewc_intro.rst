For StackStorm versions earlier than 3.3, Extreme Networks provided a commercial version of the StackStorm automation platform (EWC). EWC added priority
support, advanced features such as fine-tuned access control (RBAC), LDAP, and Workflow Designer.

Extreme Workflow Composer was donated to Linux Foundation, but those components are not yet integrated into the StackStorm release. Please visit https://stackstorm.com/2020/05/27/extreme-networks-donates-ewc-to-linux-foundation/ for more details.

These components are NOT available in the StackStorm 3.3 release, but will be integrated into the community edition of StackStorm in future release(s).
