For StackStorm versions earlier than 3.3, Extreme Networks provided a commercial version of the StackStorm automation platform (EWC). EWC added priority
support, advanced features such as fine-tuned access control (RBAC), LDAP, and Workflow Designer.

The EWC components have been gifted to the Linux Foundation, but have not yet been integrated into the StackStorm release.

These components are NOT available in the StackStorm 3.3 release, but will be integrated into the community edition of StackStorm in future release(s).
