How Are Vulnerabilities Handled
-------------------------------

We follow the industry de facto standard of `Responsible Disclosure <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure>`_
for handling security issues. This means we disclose the issue only after a fix or mitigation for
the issue has been released.

We of course always give full credit to people who have reported the issue.
