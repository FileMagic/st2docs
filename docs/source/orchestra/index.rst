Orchestra
=========

.. warning::
   Orchestra is currently in beta and features are subject to change.

Orchestra is a native workflow engine designed specifically for |st2| to replace ActionChain
and Mistral. Orchestra supports complex workflows with forks and joins that ActionChain lacks.
It is a subcomponent of |st2| and does not require a separate authentication system and
database like Mistral.
